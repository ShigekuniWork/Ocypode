# Document Style Guide

This guide provides guidelines for technical writing in this project.

## Clarity and Simplicity

- Keep sentences short: aim for 20-25 words per sentence
- Place subjects and predicates close together
- Prefer active voice over passive voice
- Write with the reader in mind

## Audience Awareness

- Write for the intended skill level of your readers
- Add explanations only when necessary for understanding
- Omit information readers already know; explain only what they don't
- Provide context when needed to ensure everyone can understand

## Terminology and Style

- Maintain consistency in terminology (e.g., use "deploy" consistently; don't mix with "release")
- Expand abbreviations and technical terms on first use
- Omit unnecessary expressions to keep writing concise

## Structure and Readability

- Organize headings hierarchically
- Use numbered lists for procedures
- Keep bullet points to 3-5 items
- Ensure code examples are executable

## Voice and Tone

- Avoid redundant polite expressions (use "do X" instead of "please do X")
- Maintain consistent voice throughout (either "desu-masu" style or "dearu" style in Japanese; for English, use a consistent formal or informal tone)

## Figures, Tables, and Links

- Always add captions to figures and tables
- Use external links only to official guidelines or reliable sources
- Use descriptive link text (e.g., "Google's Style Guide" instead of "here")

## Markdown Format

- Write documentation in Markdown format unless there's a special reason not to
- For detailed Markdown syntax and conventions, refer to the [Google Markdown Style Guide](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/docguide/style.md)
